##Theory 

Control structures in shell scripting are used to control the flow of program execution.

A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known; it repeats a block of code for a fixed range.

A while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.

Nested loops are used when one loop runs inside another loop, commonly used for pattern printing.

In this experiment, nested for loops are used to print increasing and decreasing star patterns.

##Algorithm

Start the program.

Accept value of n from the user.

Use a for loop from 1 to n.

Print * i times in each row.

Use another for loop from n-1 down to 1.

Print * i times in each row.

Stop the program.
